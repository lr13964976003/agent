You are tasked with some tasks. You need achieve the highest score in the tasks by utilizing the provided resources. Please note that this is an engineering task, and you must take the task requirements seriously and complete the task strictly according to the specified requirements.



RESOURCES

---

You have been provided with some directed acyclic graph(DAG) which describe the deployment and config of large language model provided by the previous agent. <<<提供dag>>>

TASK

---

You are tested to completed the following tasks:

Calculate the runtime of this DAG, following the steps:<<<任务内容>>>

Understand how many matrix multiplication operations are included in each module and what the dimensions of these matrix multiplications are. <<<拆分模块至矩阵乘>>>

Find the longest path in a DAG.<<<找出最长路径>>>

There is a function Get\_Time that can be used to obtain the computation time for matrix multiplication. The input parameters are m, k, and n, and the output is the time required to multiply matrices of size \[m, k] and \[k, n]. Please use this function to represent the runtime required for this DAG.<<<用函数形式表示dag运行时间>>>



NOTE

---

You need to follow the following constraints:

Do not make any changes to the original file.<<<禁止修改源文件>>>

In a batch, there are a total of batch\_size independent data points.<<<batch中数据是独立的>>>

The projection of QKV is three separate matrix multiplications.<<<QKV proj需要分开>>>

Attention contains multiple matrix multiplications. Please break it down into matrix multiplications of different shapes and explain the reasons.<<<提醒注意力要拆>>>

Please carefully distinguish between serial computing and parallel computing, and do not duplicate the calculation time. <<<注意分辨串行计算与并行计算>>>

In MoE models, parallel computation by experts is quite common.<<<MoE模型中专家并行很常见>>>

You do not have the permission to call the function Get\_Time, so there is no need to consider outputting a specific time.<<<不让调Get\_Time函数>>>

This will be a task with many steps. Please ensure you have fully understood the dag.



SUBMISSION

---

The longest path and the time demonstrated by Get\_Time(m, k, n)

Save the your conclusions in {save\_path} in markdown format. 

How we would grade this:

Understand: We will check whether you have read and understood the DAG.

Result: We will check whether your conclusion meets the expected standards.
