# DAG Analysis Report - Required Modifications

## Issues Found

### 1. Missing Connections in Layer 0 Attention
The following nodes have connectivity issues:

#### Nodes without outputs (should have QKV projections):
- `ln_l0_tp1` (LayerNorm L0 for TP Group 1)
- `ln_l0_tp2` (LayerNorm L0 for TP Group 2)  
- `ln_l0_tp3` (LayerNorm L0 for TP Group 3)

#### Nodes without inputs (should receive from QKV projections):
- `all_reduce_tp1_l0` (All-Reduce for TP Group 1)
- `all_reduce_tp2_l0` (All-Reduce for TP Group 2)
- `all_reduce_tp3_l0` (All-Reduce for TP Group 3)

## Required Modifications

### Missing QKV connections for TP Group 1:
- Add: `ln_l0_tp1 -> qkv_l0_gpu4`
- Add: `ln_l0_tp1 -> qkv_l0_gpu5`
- Add: `qkv_l0_gpu4 -> all_reduce_tp1_l0`
- Add: `qkv_l0_gpu5 -> all_reduce_tp1_l0`

### Missing QKV connections for TP Group 2:
- Add: `ln_l0_tp2 -> qkv_l0_gpu6`
- Add: `ln_l0_tp2 -> qkv_l0_gpu7`
- Add: `qkv_l0_gpu6 -> all_reduce_tp2_l0`
- Add: `qkv_l0_gpu7 -> all_reduce_tp2_l0`

### Missing QKV connections for TP Group 3:
- Add: `ln_l0_tp3 -> qkv_l0_gpu8`
- Add: `ln_l0_tp3 -> qkv_l0_gpu9`
- Add: `qkv_l0_gpu8 -> all_reduce_tp3_l0`
- Add: `qkv_l0_gpu9 -> all_reduce_tp3_l0`

## Summary
The DAG is incorrect due to missing connections in the Layer 0 attention path for TP Groups 1, 2, and 3. The TP Group 0 structure appears correct, but the other TP groups are missing their complete QKV projection flow.
