# DAG Validation Report

## Baseline DAG Analysis
**File**: `baseline_dag.dot`

### Results
- **Cycle Detection**: ✅ No cycles detected
- **Input Node Validation**: ✅ All nodes except input have at least one input node
- **Output Node Validation**: ✅ All nodes except output have at least one output node

### Summary
The baseline DAG is structurally correct with no violations.

## FA Pool DAG Analysis  
**File**: `fa_pool_dag.dot`

### Results
- **Cycle Detection**: ✅ No cycles detected
- **Input Node Validation**: ❌ **VIOLATION** - Node `resource_mgr` has only incoming edges, no outgoing edges
- **Output Node Validation**: ✅ All nodes except output have at least one output node

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issue: Resource Manager Node
- **Node**: `resource_mgr`
- **Type**: Diamond shape (decision/condition node)
- **Problem**: Has only incoming edge from `input`, but no outgoing edges to other nodes
- **Impact**: This breaks the DAG flow as resource manager cannot determine when to activate the attention pool

#### Required Fix
The `resource_mgr` node must have outgoing edges to:
1. `embed` node (to activate base layer)
2. `kv_cache` node (to activate attention pool)

### Current Structure Issues
```
Current: input -> resource_mgr [STOPS HERE]
Required: input -> resource_mgr -> embed
                     resource_mgr -> kv_cache
```

## Final Conclusion

**The DAGs are INCORRECT** due to the structural issue in the FA Pool DAG. The `resource_mgr` node violates the requirement that all nodes (except output) must have at least one output node.

## Nodes That Need Modification

### FA Pool DAG
- **resource_mgr**: Must add outgoing edges to `embed` and `kv_cache` nodes

## Baseline DAG
- No modifications needed - structure is correct
