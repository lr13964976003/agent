# FA Pool: Methodology Extraction

## Abstract (Retained)
The computational complexity of attention mechanisms in transformer-based models grows quadratically with sequence length, creating a significant bottleneck for processing long sequences. We propose FA Pool (Flash Attention Pool), a novel dynamic parallel strategy that intelligently allocates GPU resources based on sequence length thresholds. When input sequences exceed a predetermined length, FA Pool activates additional GPU resources to form a computation pool dedicated to parallel attention calculations, thereby reducing the computational burden on individual GPUs. Our approach combines the benefits of Flash Attention's memory-efficient algorithms with dynamic resource allocation to achieve superior scaling characteristics. Experimental results on a 4-layer Dense model demonstrate that FA Pool achieves significant improvements in both Time Per Output Token (TPOT) and Tokens Per Second (TPS) metrics compared to traditional static parallelization strategies (TP=8, PP=2 baseline). The strategy shows particular effectiveness for long sequence processing, achieving up to 3.2x improvement in TPOT and 2.8x improvement in TPS for sequences exceeding 8K tokens.

### 3.3 Attention Parallelization Implementation

#### Block-wise Parallelization Algorithm
```
Input: Query Q, Key K, Value V, sequence length n, number of pool GPUs p
Output: Attention output O

1. Block size calculation: b = ceil(n / p)
2. For each GPU i in pool:
   - Extract block: Q_i = Q[i*b:(i+1)*b]
   - Full KV access: K_i = K, V_i = V (replicated)
   - Compute local attention: O_i = FlashAttention(Q_i, K, V)
3. Synchronize and aggregate results: O = concat(O_0, O_1, ..., O_p-1)
4. Return final output O
```

#### GPU Memory Layout per Pool GPU
- **Query Block**: (batch_size, b, 4096) - varies with sequence length
- **Keys**: (batch_size, n, 4096) - full sequence, replicated
- **Values**: (batch_size, n, 4096) - full sequence, replicated
- **Output Block**: (batch_size, b, 4096) - computed locally
- **Flash Attention Cache**: ~20GB additional for block computation

### 3.4 Communication Optimization Details

#### KV Cache Sharing Strategy
- **Replication Pattern**: Full KV replication across all pool GPUs
- **Memory Trade-off**: Increased memory usage for reduced communication
- **Synchronization**: One-time replication at attention start

Time 1-2ms: Attention computation starts on pool GPUs
Time 2-3ms: FFN continues, attention parallel computation

```
