# DAG Validation Report - Final Analysis

Based on the inspection of both DAG files provided, here are the findings:

## Check Results

### ma_separation_dag.dot - **INCORRECT**

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Missing output connection**: Node `ln1_l1` has only in-degree but no out-degree
2. **Disconnected output**: Node `final_output` exists but has no incoming edges
3. **Violates requirement**: Not all nodes (except output) have at least one output node

**Nodes to modify:**
- `ln1_l1`: Needs to be connected to `final_output`
- `final_output`: Needs incoming edge from `ln1_l1`

### baseline_dag.dot - **CORRECT**

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ **No cycles detected**: The DAG is acyclic
- ✅ **All nodes have proper inputs**: All nodes except `input_l0` have at least one input
- ✅ **All nodes have proper outputs**: All nodes except `output` have at least one output

## Required Modifications

The following nodes need modification in ma_separation_dag.dot:

### ma_separation_dag.dot

```dot
// Add this edge:
ln1_l1 -> final_output;
```

This will complete the DAG structure by ensuring:
1. `ln1_l1` has both in-degree and out-degree
2. `final_output` properly receives input and serves as the terminal node
3. All requirements are satisfied

The baseline_dag.dot file requires no modifications and is ready for submission.
