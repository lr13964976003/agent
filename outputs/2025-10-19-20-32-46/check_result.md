# DAG Validation Report

## Check Results Summary

Both DAGs have been thoroughly examined and **pass all validation criteria**.

### Baseline Tensor Pipeline Parallel DAG ✓
- **Cycle Detection**: No cycles found
- **Input Node Validation**: Only `input_stage0` has only outgoing connections
- **Output Node Validation**: Only `output` has only incoming connections
- **All Intermediate Nodes**: Have both incoming and outgoing connections

### Proposed Layer-wise Cache Optimized DAG ✓
- **Cycle Detection**: No cycles found
- **Input Node Validation**: Only `input` has only outgoing connections
- **Output Node Validation**: Only `output` has only incoming connections
- **All Intermediate Nodes**: Have both incoming and outgoing connections

## Conclusion

**Congratulation!!** Both DAGs are structurally correct and meet all specified requirements:
1. No cycles present in either DAG
2. All nodes except input nodes have at least one input connection
3. All nodes except output nodes have at least one output connection

No modifications are required.
