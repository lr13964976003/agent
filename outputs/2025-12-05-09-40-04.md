# DAG Validation Report – EP64_TP2_Hybrid_Optimized

**Inspection Date:** 2025-12-05 09:40:04  
**DAG File:** temp_llm_dag.dot  
**Status:** ✅ PASSED – No errors detected

## Checklist Results

1. **Cycle Detection**  
   - Cycle found: **No**

2. **Node Input Requirements (non-input nodes must have ≥1 input edge)**  
   - Nodes with zero in-degree: `input` (expected)  
   - All other nodes have at least one incoming edge.

3. **Node Output Requirements (non-output nodes must have ≥1 output edge)**  
   - Nodes with zero out-degree: `output` (expected)  
   - All other nodes have at least one outgoing edge.

4. **GPU Communication Completeness**  
   Every GPU-to-GPU communication is explicitly identified and labeled with exact GPU ranges:
   - `embed_allreduce` – All-Reduce across GPU 0,1
   - `broadcast_expert` – Broadcast GPU 0,1 → 2-65
   - `alltoall_expert` – All-to-All among GPU 2-65
   - `reduce_scatter` – Reduce-Scatter GPU 2-65 → 66,67
   - `agg_allreduce` – All-Reduce across GPU 66,67

   No undocumented or vague GPU communications exist.

## Conclusion
The DAG topology, logical semantics, and GPU communication annotations are correct and complete as provided. No modifications are required.
