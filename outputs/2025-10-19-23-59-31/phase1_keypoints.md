# MA Separation: Key Points Extract

## Abstract (Retained as-is)
Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## Key Contributions
1. **MA Separation Architecture**: Parallel strategy replicating attention computation across multiple GPUs to synchronize with MoE execution time
2. **Load Balancing Algorithm**: Dynamic scheduling optimizing distribution of attention and expert computations across GPUs
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Experimental validation on 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs
4. **Scalability Analysis**: Theoretical and empirical analysis across different model configurations and GPU counts

## Core Problem
Temporal mismatch: T_attention > T_moe when experts are distributed across multiple GPUs, creating idle time for expert resources while attention computation completes.

## Key Insight
By parallelizing attention computation to match MoE execution time, we can eliminate the attention bottleneck while fully utilizing expert parallelism.

## Optimal GPU Allocation
GPU allocation ratio of 3:1 for Attention and MoE is most appropriate.
