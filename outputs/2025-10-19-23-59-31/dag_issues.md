# DAG Analysis Report

## Summary
This DAG contains **critical structural errors** that need to be addressed.

## Issues Found

### 1. Missing Input Connections
The following nodes have **only outgoing edges** (no input connections):
- **input** - Missing connection to embedding layer
- **expert_layer_0_expert_14_gpu_15** - Missing input connection
- **expert_layer_0_expert_15_gpu_15** - Missing input connection
- **gate_layer_0** through **gate_layer_3** - Missing input connections
- **qkv_layer_0_gpu_0** through **qkv_layer_3_gpu_11** - Missing input connections
- **attention_layer_0_gpu_0** through **attention_layer_3_gpu_11** - Missing input connections
- **attention_agg_layer_0** through **attention_agg_layer_3** - Missing input connections
- **out_proj_layer_0** through **out_proj_layer_3** - Missing input connections
- **expert_agg_layer_0** through **expert_agg_layer_3** - Missing input connections

### 2. Missing Output Connections
The following nodes have **only incoming edges** (no output connections):
- **output** - Missing connections from final layer
- **residual1_layer_0** through **residual1_layer_3** - Missing output connections
- **residual2_layer_0** through **residual2_layer_3** - Missing output connections
- **ln2_layer_0** through **ln2_layer_3** - Missing output connections

## Required Modifications

### Missing Edges to Add:

#### Input Connections
```
input -> embedding
```

#### Output Connections
```
[final_residual_layer] -> output
```

#### Intermediate Layer Connections
The DAG appears to be incomplete as it cuts off mid-way. The following patterns need completion:

1. **Layer 0 Chain**: 
   - residual2_layer_0 should connect to ln1_layer_1
   - And continue the pattern for layers 1, 2, and 3

2. **Final Connections**:
   - residual2_layer_3 should connect to output

## Critical Missing Components

The DAG definition appears truncated at the end, cutting off after:
```
ln2_layer_1 -> expert_layer_1_expert_9_gpu_14
```

This indicates the DAG file is incomplete and needs the remaining connections to be properly defined.
