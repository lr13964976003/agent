# DAG Validation Report

## Executive Summary
All DAGs have been thoroughly examined for structural correctness based on the specified criteria. All DAGs are valid and correctly structured.

## Validation Criteria Results

### 1. Cycle Detection
**PASS** - No cycles detected in any of the DAGs:
- ma_separation_dag.dot: No cycles
- baseline_tp8_pp2_dag.dot: No cycles
- tp8_standalone_dag.dot: No cycles
- pp2_standalone_dag.dot: No cycles

### 2. Input Node Validation
**PASS** - All nodes except input have at least one input node:
- Only the 'input' node has only outgoing edges (expected)
- All other nodes have incoming edges as required

### 3. Output Node Validation
**PASS** - All nodes except output have at least one output node:
- Only the 'output' node has only incoming edges (expected)
- All other nodes have outgoing edges as required

## Conclusion
All DAGs are correctly structured and meet the specified validation criteria. No modifications are needed.
