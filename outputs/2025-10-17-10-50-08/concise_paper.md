# MA Separation: A Novel Parallel Strategy for MoE-Attention Co-execution in Large Language Models

## Abstract

Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models has led to increased computational demands, particularly with attention mechanisms growing quadratically with sequence length. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures offer increased capacity without proportional computational cost, but face a fundamental challenge: temporal mismatch between attention computation (sequential, O(n²d)) and expert execution (parallel). Current TP=8, PP=2 strategies don't address this imbalance, leading to suboptimal GPU utilization.

## 3. MA Separation Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation
- **Temporal Mismatch**: T_attention > T_moe when experts distributed across GPUs
- **Solution**: GPU allocation ratio of 3:1 for Attention:MoE

### 3.2 MA Separation Architecture

#### Attention Parallelization Strategy (3-Stage)
**Stage 1: QKV Projection**
- Input replicated across k=12 attention GPUs
- Each GPU handles subset of 32 attention heads
- Formula: head_start = i * (32 / 12), head_end = (i+1) * (32 / 12)

**Stage 2: Attention Computation**
- All-reduce operations for information exchange
- Attention scores: attention_scores_i = compute_attention(Q_i, K_all, V_all)

**Stage 3: Output Aggregation**
- Multi-GPU aggregation: final_output = all_reduce(output_1, ..., output_12)
- Broadcast to 4 MoE GPUs

#### MoE Parallelization Strategy
- **16 experts** distributed across 4 MoE GPUs
- **Experts per GPU**: 16/4 = 4 experts per GPU
- **Top-K routing**: K=2
- **Dynamic load balancing** based on utilization

### 3.3 Synchronization Mechanism
**Time Prediction Model**: Predicts execution times based on sequence length (2048), hidden dimension (4096), active experts, and GPU load
**Dynamic Load Balancing**: Real-time adjustment of attention heads and expert assignments
**Barrier Synchronization**: CUDA events for precise timing control

### 3.4 Communication Optimization
- **Hierarchical all-reduce** for attention output aggregation
- **Gradient compression** via top-K sparsification
- **Overlapped communication** with computation
