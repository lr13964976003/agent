# Nodes Requiring Modification in DAG

## Issues Found

### 1. Nodes with Only In-Degree (No Input Connections)
These nodes are missing required input connections:
- **FFN_Gate_Split1**: Has no input edges, should receive input from FFN_LayerNorm1
- **LayerNorm2**: Has no input edges, should receive input from Pipeline_Comm1
- **Positional_Encoding**: Has no input edges, should receive input from Embedding_AllGather
- **FFN_Up_Split1**: Has no input edges, should receive input from FFN_LayerNorm1
- **Output**: Has no input edges, should receive input from Output_LayerNorm

### 2. Nodes with Only Out-Degree (No Output Connections)
These nodes are missing required output connections:
- **Residual_Add4**: Has no output edges, should output to Output_LayerNorm
- **Input**: This is the input node, so this is acceptable
- **Residual_Add2**: Has no output edges, should output to Pipeline_Comm1
- **LayerNorm1**: Has no output edges, should output to MHA_Query_Split1, MHA_Key_Split1, and MHA_Value_Split1

## Summary of Required Fixes

Total nodes needing modification: **8 nodes**

### Priority Fixes:
1. **Positional_Encoding** - Needs input from Embedding_AllGather
2. **LayerNorm1** - Needs outputs to MHA_Query_Split1, MHA_Key_Split1, MHA_Value_Split1
3. **Residual_Add2** - Needs output to Pipeline_Comm1
4. **Residual_Add4** - Needs output to Output_LayerNorm
5. **FFN_Gate_Split1** - Needs input from FFN_LayerNorm1
6. **FFN_Up_Split1** - Needs input from FFN_LayerNorm1
7. **LayerNorm2** - Needs input from Pipeline_Comm1
8. **Output** - Needs input from Output_LayerNorm

Note: The Input node having only out-degree is expected behavior for the input node, so it does not need modification.
