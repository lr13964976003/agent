# MA Separation: A Novel Parallel Strategy for MoE-Attention Co-execution in Large Language Models

## Abstract

Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models has created a fundamental challenge: temporal mismatch between attention computation (sequential, O(n²d)) and MoE execution (parallel across experts). Traditional parallel strategies (TP, PP) fail to address this computational imbalance, leading to inefficient GPU utilization with attention bottlenecks while expert resources remain idle.

We introduce MA Separation, which replicates attention computation across multiple GPUs to synchronize with parallel MoE operations, achieving T_attention ≈ T_moe for simultaneous completion and maximum GPU utilization.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation
- **Temporal mismatch**: T_attention > T_moe when experts distributed across GPUs
- **Goal**: Synchronize attention and MoE execution times through parallelization

### 2.2 MA Separation Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Attention Parallelization Strategy

**Hardware Distribution:**
- **Attention GPUs**: 8 GPUs (0-7)
- **Attention heads per GPU**: 4 (32 total heads distributed)
- **MoE GPUs**: 8 GPUs (8-15)  
- **Experts per GPU**: 2 (16 total experts distributed)

**Three-Stage Parallelization:**

**Stage 1: QKV Projection Parallelization**
```
For GPU i in [0-7]:
    head_start = i * 4  # 4 heads per GPU
    head_end = (i+1) * 4
    Q_i, K_i, V_i = projection_layers[head_start:head_end](input)
```

**Stage 2: Attention Score Computation**
```
For GPU i in [0-7]:
    attention_scores_i = compute_attention(Q_i, K_all, V_all)
    output_i = attention_scores_i @ V_all
```

**Stage 3: Output Aggregation**
```
final_output = all_reduce(output_0, ..., output_7)
broadcast_to_moe_gpus(final_output)
```

#### 2.2.2 MoE Parallelization Strategy

**Expert Distribution:**
```
experts_per_gpu = 16 / 8 = 2
For GPU j in [8-15]:
    hosted_experts = experts[(j-8)*2 : (j-8+1)*2]
```

**Routing and Computation:**
```
gate_scores = gating_network(attention_output)
top_experts = top_k(gate_scores, k=2)
route_tokens_to_experts(tokens, top_experts)
```

### 2.3 Synchronization Mechanism

**Time Prediction Model:**
- Inputs: sequence length (2048), hidden dimension (4096), active experts, GPU load
- Outputs: predicted T_attention and T_moe

**Dynamic Load Balancing:**
```
if predicted_T_attention > predicted_T_moe:
    increase_attention_parallelism()
elif predicted_T_moe > predicted_T_attention:
    adjust_expert_distribution()
```

**Barrier Synchronization:**
- CUDA events and streams for precise timing control
- Synchronization interval: every 100 iterations
- Load balancing threshold: 5% execution time difference
