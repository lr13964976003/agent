# MA Separation: A Novel Parallel Strategy for MoE-Attention Co-execution in Large Language Models

## Abstract

Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional MoE implementations face a fundamental challenge: temporal mismatch between attention computation (sequential O(n²d) complexity) and MoE computation (parallel expert execution). Current parallel strategies (tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism) do not address this imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in MoE-based models.

## 2. Problem Formulation

In MoE transformer architectures, the temporal mismatch occurs because:
- T_attention > T_moe when experts are distributed across multiple GPUs
- Traditional approaches create idle time for expert resources while attention computation completes
- Current solutions don't synchronize attention and MoE execution times

## 3. MA Separation Methodology

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

**Key Insight**: Replicate attention computation across multiple GPUs to achieve T_attention ≈ T_moe through synchronized execution.

**GPU Allocation Strategy**: 3:1 ratio for Attention:MoE computation (12 attention GPUs, 4 MoE GPUs on 16-GPU setup)

### 3.2 Attention Parallelization

**3-Stage Approach:**
1. **Query-Key-Value Projection**: Distribute attention heads across 12 GPUs
   - Heads per GPU: [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2] for 32 total heads
   - GPU mapping: [0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14]

2. **Attention Score Computation**: Parallel computation with all-reduce synchronization
   - Buffer size: 32MB per transfer
   - Algorithm: Hierarchical ring all-reduce

3. **Output Aggregation**: Broadcast results to MoE GPUs
   - Communication: Hierarchical all-reduce (intra-node then inter-node)
   - Latency: 5μs inter-node, 1μs intra-node

### 3.3 MoE Parallelization

**Expert Distribution:**
- 16 experts distributed across 4 MoE GPUs
- 4 experts per GPU on GPUs [3,7,11,15]
- Expert memory: 256MB per expert (4 experts × 256MB = 1GB per MoE GPU)

**Routing Configuration:**
- Top-k routing with k=2
- Gate dimension: 4096
- Capacity factor: 1.0
- Load balancing: Dynamic based on real-time utilization

### 3.4 Synchronization Mechanism

**Time Prediction Model:**
```
T_attention = 0.0012 + 0.000034*seq_len + 0.0000087*hidden_dim
T_moe = 0.0008 + 0.000045*expert_dim + 0.000012*active_experts
```

**Dynamic Load Balancing:**
- Threshold: Rebalance when 15% time difference detected
- Range: 8-14 attention GPUs dynamically adjustable
- Interval: Every 100 training steps
