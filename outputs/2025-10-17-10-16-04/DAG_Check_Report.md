# DAG Validation Report

## Executive Summary
All Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) have been thoroughly inspected and found to be **correct** with no violations of the specified criteria.

## Inspection Results

### 1. Cycle Detection
- **ma_separation.dot**: ✅ No cycles detected
- **baseline_tp8_pp2.dot**: ✅ No cycles detected

### 2. Input Node Validation
- **ma_separation.dot**: ✅ All nodes except 'input' have at least one input node
- **baseline_tp8_pp2.dot**: ✅ All nodes except 'input' have at least one input node

### 3. Output Node Validation
- **ma_separation.dot**: ✅ All nodes except 'output' have at least one output node
- **baseline_tp8_pp2.dot**: ✅ All nodes except 'output' have at least one output node

## Conclusion
Both DAGs fully comply with the engineering requirements. No modifications are necessary.

**Status: PASSED**
