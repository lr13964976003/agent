# MA Separation: A Novel Parallel Strategy for MoE-Attention Co-execution in Large Language Models

## Abstract

Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## 1. Introduction

Large language models face computational challenges with quadratic attention complexity and linear model depth scaling. While MoE architectures offer increased capacity without proportional computational cost, they suffer from temporal mismatch: attention computation (O(n²) sequential) creates bottlenecks while MoE experts (parallel across GPUs) remain underutilized.

Traditional parallel strategies (tensor and pipeline parallelism) don't address this fundamental imbalance. MA Separation introduces a novel approach by replicating attention computation across GPUs to synchronize with MoE execution times, maximizing GPU utilization.

**Contributions:**
1. MA Separation Architecture: Synchronized attention-MoE co-execution
2. Dynamic Load Balancing: Real-time optimization
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: 16-GPU experimental validation
4. Scalability Analysis: Performance across configurations
