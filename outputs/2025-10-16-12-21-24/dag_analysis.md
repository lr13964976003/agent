# DAG Analysis Report

## Inspection Results

### 1. Cycle Check
- **Result**: PASS
- **Details**: The DAG does not contain any cycles.

### 2. Input Node Validation
- **Result**: PASS
- **Details**: All nodes except the input node ('input') have at least one input node.
- **Nodes with only incoming edges**: {'output', 'layer_0_output'}

### 3. Output Node Validation
- **Result**: FAIL
- **Issue Identified**: The following nodes have no outgoing edges but are not the final output:
  - `layer_0_output`: This node only has incoming edges but is not the final output node
  - `layer_1_output`: This node only has incoming edges but is not the final output node
  - `layer_2_output`: This node only has incoming edges but is not the final output node

## Required Modifications

The DAG structure has a critical issue where intermediate layer outputs (`layer_0_output`, `layer_1_output`, `layer_2_output`) are not properly connected to subsequent layers. These nodes currently act as dead-ends in the graph.

### Nodes that need modification:

1. **`layer_0_output`**
   - **Issue**: Has no outgoing edges
   - **Required fix**: Should connect to `layer_1_distribute`

2. **`layer_1_output`**
   - **Issue**: Has no outgoing edges
   - **Required fix**: Should connect to `layer_2_distribute`

3. **`layer_2_output`**
   - **Issue**: Has no outgoing edges
   - **Required fix**: Should connect to `layer_3_distribute`

### Current incorrect edges:
```
layer_0_output → [no outgoing edges]
layer_1_output → [no outgoing edges]
layer_2_output → [no outgoing edges]
```

### Corrected edges should be:
```
layer_0_output → layer_1_distribute
layer_1_output → layer_2_distribute
layer_2_output → layer_3_distribute
```
