# DAG Verification Results

## Verification Summary
All DAGs have been successfully verified against the specified criteria.

## Verification Criteria Checklist

### 1. Cycle Detection
- ✅ **PASSED**: No cycles detected in any DAG

### 2. Input Node Validation  
- ✅ **PASSED**: All nodes (except designated input nodes) have at least one input
- Each DAG has exactly one node with only outgoing edges: `model_input` or `input`

### 3. Output Node Validation
- ✅ **PASSED**: All nodes (except designated output nodes) have at least one output  
- Each DAG has exactly one node with only incoming edges: `model_output` or `output`
