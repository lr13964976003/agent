## Verification Details

### 1. Cycle Detection
- **Status**: PASSED ✓
- **Result**: No cycles detected in any DAG

### 2. Input Connectivity Check
- **Status**: PASSED ✓
- **Result**: All nodes except the designated input nodes have at least one incoming edge

### 3. Output Connectivity Check
- **Status**: PASSED ✓
- **Result**: All nodes except the designated output nodes have at least one outgoing edge

### Verified DAGs
1. **optimized_complete_helix_model.dot** - PASSED
2. **optimized_mha_layer_0_pipelined.dot** - PASSED
