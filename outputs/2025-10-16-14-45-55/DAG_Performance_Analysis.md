# DAG Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the runtime of the provided Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language model deployment. The analysis identifies all matrix multiplication operations and determines the longest path for runtime calculation.

## Model Architecture Overview

The DAG represents a 4-layer transformer model with:
- **Batch size**: 1024 independent data points
- **Sequence length**: 2048 tokens
- **Hidden dimension**: 4096
- **Attention heads**: 128 per GPU (distributed across 8 GPUs per stage)
- **Expert count**: 8 experts per MoE layer (2 GPUs per expert in baseline)
- **Pipeline stages**: 2 stages (layers 0-1 on GPUs 0-7, layers 2-3 on GPUs 8-15)

## Matrix Multiplication Operations Analysis

### 1. QKV Projection (Per Layer)
**Operation**: Linear projection for Query, Key, Value matrices
- **Dimensions**: [1024, 2048, 4096] × [4096, 128] → [1024, 2048, 128]
- **Count**: 3 separate matrix multiplications (Q, K, V)
- **Parallelization**: Across 8 GPUs per stage
- **Total FLOPs per projection**: 3 × (1024 × 2048 × 4096 × 128)

### 2. Attention Computation
**Breaking down attention into matrix multiplications:**

#### 2.1 Query-Key Multiplication
- **Dimensions**: [1024, 2048, 128] × [1024, 128, 2048] → [1024, 2048, 2048]
- **Operation**: Q × K^T for attention scores
- **Note**: This is computed after head splitting - actual dims are [1024, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim]

#### 2.2 Attention-Value Multiplication
- **Dimensions**: [1024, 2048, 2048] × [1024, 2048, 128] → [1024, 2048, 128]
- **Operation**: Attention weights × V
- **Note**: Again, computed as [1024, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len] × [1024, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim]

#### 2.3 Attention Output Projection
- **Dimensions**: [1024, 2048, 128] × [128, 4096] → [1024, 2048, 4096]
- **Operation**: Project concatenated attention heads back to hidden dimension

### 3. MoE (Mixture of Experts) Components

#### 3.1 Gate Network
- **Dimensions**: [1024, 2048, 4096] × [4096, 16] → [1024, 2048, 16]
- **Operation**: Compute routing probabilities for 8 experts

#### 3.2 Expert Networks (Parallel Execution)
Each expert contains:
- **Expert 0-7**: [1024, 2048, 4096] × [4096, 4096] → [1024, 2048, 4096]
- **Note**: 8 parallel experts, but only 2 experts per GPU due to 2-GPU expert allocation

#### 3.3 Expert Aggregation
- **Dimensions**: Weighted sum of expert outputs based on gate scores
- **Operation**: Not a matrix multiplication, but element-wise multiplication and reduction

### 4. Residual Connections
- **Operation**: Element-wise addition, no matrix multiplication

## Longest Path Analysis

### Critical Path Identification
The longest path through the DAG determines the total runtime. Based on the dependencies:

**Longest Path**:
```
Input → 
l0_mha_qkv → l0_mha_attn → l0_mha_out → l0_mha_res → 
l0_moe_gate → l0_moe_exp0 (parallel with exp2,4,6) → l0_moe_agg → l0_moe_res → 
l1_mha_qkv → l1_mha_attn → l1_mha_out → l1_mha_res → 
l1_moe_gate → l1_moe_exp0 (parallel with exp2,4,6) → l1_moe_agg → l1_moe_res → 
stage0_to_stage1 → 
l2_mha_qkv → l2_mha_attn → l2_mha_out → l2_mha_res → 
l2_moe_gate → l2_moe_exp0 (parallel with exp2,4,6) → l2_moe_agg → l2_moe_res → 
l3_mha_qkv → l3_mha_attn → l3_mha_out → l3_mha_res → 
l3_moe_gate → l3_moe_exp0 (parallel with exp2,4,6) → l3_moe_agg → l3_moe_res → 
Output
```

### Serial vs Parallel Operations

**Serial Operations** (must complete sequentially):
1. Layer 0: QKV → Attention → Output → Residual → Gate → Expert Aggregation → Residual
2. Pipeline communication between stage 0 and stage 1
3. Layer 2: Same sequence as layer 0
4. Layer 3: Same sequence as layer 0

**Parallel Operations** (can execute simultaneously):
1. **Expert computation**: All 8 experts run in parallel
2. **Multi-head attention**: Distributed across GPUs within a stage
3. **Pipeline parallelism**: Layers 0-1 run in parallel with layers 2-3 when pipeline is full

### Runtime Calculation Using Get_Time

The runtime for each matrix multiplication can be represented as:

#### Layer 0 (GPUs 0-7):
- **QKV Projection**: Get_Time(1024×2048, 4096, 128) × 3
- **Attention Q×K^T**: Get_Time(1024×2048, 128, 2048)
- **Attention A×V**: Get_Time(1024×2048, 2048, 128)
- **Output Projection**: Get_Time(1024×2048, 128, 4096)
- **Gate Network**: Get_Time(1024×2048, 4096, 16)
- **Expert Computation**: Get_Time(1024×2048, 4096, 4096) (parallel across 8 experts)

#### Pipeline Communication:
- **Stage 0 to Stage 1**: Communication overhead (not matrix multiplication)

#### Layer 2 (GPUs 8-15):
- Same operations as Layer 0

#### Layer 3:
- Same operations as Layer 0

## Critical Path Runtime Breakdown

The longest path runtime is determined by:

1. **Layer 0 complete execution**: 
   QKV + Attention + Output + Gate + Expert Aggregation
   
2. **Layer 1 complete execution**: Same as layer 0

3. **Pipeline communication**: Stage transfer overhead

4. **Layer 2 complete execution**: Same as layer 0

5. **Layer 3 complete execution**: Same as layer 0

**Total Runtime** = Sum of serial operations on the critical path

= Get_Time(1024×2048, 4096, 128) × 3  (QKV projections)
+ Get_Time(1024×2048, 128, 2048)       (Q×K^T)
+ Get_Time(1024×2048, 2048, 128)       (A×V)
+ Get_Time(1024×2048, 128, 4096)       (Output projection)
+ Get_Time(1024×2048, 4096, 16)        (Gate network)
+ Get_Time(1024×2048, 4096, 4096)      (Expert computation)
+ Pipeline communication overhead

This pattern repeats for each layer. The actual runtime will depend on the specific Get_Time implementation, but the longest path follows this sequence of operations.

## Key Observations

1. **Pipeline depth**: 4 layers across 2 pipeline stages
2. **Expert parallelization**: 8 experts run in parallel within each MoE layer
3. **Head parallelization**: 128 attention heads distributed across 8 GPUs
4. **Communication overhead**: Significant factor between pipeline stages
5. **Memory constraints**: Large model requires GPU distribution due to parameter count

The longest path is clearly defined by the layer-wise dependencies, with expert computation being the most computationally intensive step due to the large matrix dimensions [4096, 4096].
