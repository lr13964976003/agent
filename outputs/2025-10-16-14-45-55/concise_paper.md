# MA Separation: A Novel Parallel Strategy for MoE-Attention Co-execution in Large Language Models

## Abstract
Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models faces computational bottlenecks due to the temporal mismatch between attention computation (O(n²) sequential) and MoE execution (parallel expert activation). Traditional parallel strategies (TP, PP) treat components monolithically without addressing this computational imbalance.

**Our Contributions:**
1. MA Separation Architecture: Replicates attention across GPUs to synchronize with MoE execution
2. Dynamic Load Balancing: Real-time optimization of attention/expert distribution
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: 4-layer MoE, 16 experts, 16 GPUs
4. Scalability Analysis: 87% scaling efficiency up to 16 GPUs
