# DAG Analysis Report

## Analysis of Available DAGs

### 1. optimized_pipeline_model.dot
**Status: ✓ CORRECT**

- **Cycle Check**: No cycles detected
- **Input Node Check**: All nodes except 'input' have at least one input connection
- **Output Node Check**: All nodes except 'output' have at least one output connection
- **Nodes with only in-degree**: {output}
- **Nodes with only out-degree**: {input}

### 2. micro_batch_parallelism.dot
**Status: ✗ INCORRECT**

**Issues Found:**

1. **Nodes with only in-degree (no inputs):**
   - `ln0_0` - LayerNorm Layer 0 in micro-batch 0 has no incoming edges
   - `ln0_1` - LayerNorm Layer 0 in micro-batch 1 has no incoming edges  
   - `ln0_2` - LayerNorm Layer 0 in micro-batch 2 has no incoming edges
   - `ln0_3` - LayerNorm Layer 0 in micro-batch 3 has no incoming edges

2. **Nodes with only out-degree (no outputs):**
   - `gather` - Gather Results node has no outgoing edges except to output

**Required Modifications:**

The micro-batch parallelism DAG needs to be corrected by ensuring:

1. Each `ln0_*` node (LayerNorm for each micro-batch) should receive input from its corresponding `mba*` node
2. The flow should be: `mba* -> ln0_* -> mha0_* -> mlp0_* -> ... -> gather`

**Corrected Connections:**
```
mba0 -> ln0_0
mba1 -> ln0_1  
mba2 -> ln0_2
mba3 -> ln0_3
```

### 3. Missing DAG Files
- communication_optimized_model.dot - Not found in directory
- mha_layer_0_optimized.dot - Not found in directory
- mlp_layer_0_optimized.dot - Not found in directory

## Conclusion
Only 2 out of 5 expected DAG files are available for analysis. The optimized_pipeline_model.dot is correctly structured, but the micro_batch_parallelism.dot contains structural errors that violate the DAG requirements.
