# DAG Verification Report

## Inspection Results

### 1. Cycle Detection
- **Baseline DAG**: ✅ No cycles detected
- **Proposed DAG**: ✅ No cycles detected

### 2. Input Node Requirement
- **Baseline DAG**: ✅ All nodes except 'input' have at least one input node
- **Proposed DAG**: ✅ All nodes except 'input' have at least one input node

### 3. Output Node Requirement
- **Baseline DAG**: ✅ All nodes except 'output' have at least one output node
- **Proposed DAG**: ✅ All nodes except 'output' have at least one output node

## Final Assessment
Both DAGs are structurally correct and meet all specified requirements. No modifications are needed.
