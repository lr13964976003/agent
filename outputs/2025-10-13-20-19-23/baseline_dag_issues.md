# Baseline DAG Issues

## Nodes with only in-degree (should have outputs):
- layer1_stage0_attention_residual
- model_output
- layer0_stage0_expert_aggregate
- layer1_stage0_expert_aggregate
- layer0_stage0_attention_residual
- layer3_stage1_attention_residual
- layer3_stage1_expert_aggregate
- layer2_stage1_expert_aggregate
- layer2_stage1_attention_residual

## Nodes with only out-degree (should have inputs):
- layer3_stage1_gating
- layer3_stage1_expert_residual
- layer0_stage0_gating
- layer1_stage0_gating
- layer2_stage1_expert_residual
- model_input
- layer2_stage1_gating
- layer0_stage0_expert_residual
- layer1_stage0_expert_residual

## Issues:
1. Multiple nodes are not properly connected in the graph
2. Nodes with only in-degree should have output connections
3. Nodes with only out-degree (except model_input) should have input connections

## Solution:
The baseline DAG needs to be modified to ensure all nodes (except input/output) have both input and output connections.
