# DAG Error Report

## Issues Found in DAGs

### 1. optimized_mlp_layer_0_grouped_tensor_parallel.dot
**Issues:**
- `gelu`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `ln`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `residual`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `input_split`: Node has only out-degree (no input connections)
- `fc2_split`: Node has only out-degree (no input connections)

**Expected fixes:**
- `gelu` should connect to `fc2_split` or appropriate next layer
- `ln` should connect to `input_split` or appropriate next layer
- `residual` should be an output node or connect to next layer
- `input_split` should have input connection from `ln` or appropriate previous node
- `fc2_split` should have input connection from `gelu` or appropriate previous node

### 2. optimized_mlp_layer_1_grouped_tensor_parallel.dot
**Issues:**
- `gelu`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `ln`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `residual`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `input_split`: Node has only out-degree (no input connections)
- `fc2_split`: Node has only out-degree (no input connections)

**Expected fixes:**
Same as optimized_mlp_layer_0_grouped_tensor_parallel.dot

### 3. optimized_communication_patterns.dot
**Issues:**
- `all_reduce_tg2`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)
- `all_reduce_tg3`: Node has only in-degree (no output connections)

**Expected fixes:**
- `all_reduce_tg2` should connect to appropriate next processing node
- `all_reduce_tg3` should connect to appropriate next processing node

## Summary
All DAGs are cycle-free, but three DAGs contain nodes that violate the connectivity requirements for intermediate nodes.
