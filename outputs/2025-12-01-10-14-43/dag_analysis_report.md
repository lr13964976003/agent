# DAG Analysis Report

## Analysis Summary

Both DAGs have been thoroughly analyzed and meet all specified requirements.

### Baseline DAG (baseline_tp8_pp2_moe.dag)
- ✅ **No cycles detected**: The graph is acyclic as required
- ✅ **Input node validation**: Only 'input' node has only outgoing edges
- ✅ **Output node validation**: Only 'output' node has only incoming edges  
- ✅ **Intermediate node validation**: All other nodes have both incoming and outgoing edges

### Proposed DAG (proposed_cross_node_ep16_moe.dag)
- ✅ **No cycles detected**: The graph is acyclic as required
- ✅ **Input node validation**: Only 'input' node has only outgoing edges
- ✅ **Output node validation**: Only 'output' node has only incoming edges
- ✅ **Intermediate node validation**: All other nodes have both incoming and outgoing edges

## Conclusion: Both DAGs are structurally correct and contain no errors.
