# DAG Validation Report

## Inspection Items
- **Cycle check**: PASSED (no cycles detected)
- **Non-input nodes have ≥1 input**: PASSED (only Output has in-degree only)
- **Non-output nodes have ≥1 output**: PASSED (only Input has out-degree only)

## Conclusion
The DAG is correct. No modifications required.
