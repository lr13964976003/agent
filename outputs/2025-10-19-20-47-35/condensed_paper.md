# Condensed Paper: Ring Attention with Sequence Parallelism

**Abstract**
We present a novel parallelization strategy for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in large-scale transformer models that combines Ring Attention with sequence parallelism. Our approach leverages the communication-efficient properties of the ring topology to distribute attention computation across devices, while sequence parallelism reduces memory footprint by splitting input sequences across workers. This design minimizes all-to-all communication overhead, enhances scalability for extremely long sequences, and enables efficient utilization of distributed hardware resources. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed method achieves substantial throughput improvements compared to conventional data- and tensor-parallel approaches, particularly in scenarios with high sequence length and large model size.

## 1. Introduction & Problem
Transformers face quadratic attention complexity and heavy memory requirements for distributed training/inference. Multi-Head Attention becomes a bottleneck due to communication-intensive operations, especially when scaling to trillions of parameters or handling extremely long input sequences.

## 2. Proposed Solution
**Ring Attention + Sequence Parallelism (RA+SP)** combines:
- **Ring Attention**: Replaces global communication with ring-based topology, decomposing attention into sequential peer-to-peer exchanges
- **Sequence Parallelism**: Splits input sequence across devices, enabling parallel processing without duplicating full-sequence memory

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Notation & Setup
- Input: $X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times d_{\text{model}}}$
- H attention heads, each $d_h = d_{\text{model}}/H$
- P distributed devices $\{D_0, \dots, D_{P-1}\}$

### 3.2 Sequence Parallelism
- Split sequence dimension L across P devices: $X = [X^{(0)}, \dots, X^{(P-1)}]$
- Each device stores $X^{(p)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times \frac{L}{P} \times d_{\text{model}}}$
- Reduces activation memory from $\mathcal{O}(L \cdot d_{\text{model}})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{L}{P} \cdot d_{\text{model}})$

### 3.3 Ring Attention Algorithm
**P stages:**
1. **Initialize**: Each device computes $Q^{(p)}, K^{(p)}, V^{(p)}$ from local $X^{(p)}$
2. **Ring Communication**: For t = 0..P-1:
   - Compute attention between local $Q^{(p)}$ and received $K^{(src)}, V^{(src)}$
   - Source: $(p - t) \bmod P$
   - Pass $K,V$ to next device in ring
3. **Aggregate**: After P stages, each device has complete attention for local queries

### 3.4 Implementation Details
- **Communication**: NCCL send/recv or MPI point-to-point
- **Overlap**: Computation overlaps with async communication
- **Precision**: Mixed-precision (fp16/bf16) for reduced bandwidth
- **Scalability**: Benefits increase with L and P, especially L > 16k

### 3.5 Complexity Analysis
- **Naïve All-Gather**: $\mathcal{O}(L \cdot d_{\text{model}})$ per step
- **Ring Attention**: $\mathcal{O}(\frac{L}{P} \cdot d_{\text{model}})$ per stage, P stages total
- Same total volume but lower peak bandwidth and better overlap

## 4. Experiments

### 4.1 Setup
- **Hardware**: 16×NVIDIA H100 GPUs (NVLink, NVSwitch)
- **Settings**: Inference-only, FP16, batch=1024, sequence=10000 tokens
- **Models**: 4-layer dense transformer (16 heads, 512 head-dim, 32768 MLP hidden)
- **Baselines**: Tensor Parallelism (TP=8) + Pipeline Parallelism (PP=2)

### 4.2 Results
| Method                | TPS (tokens/s) | TPOT (ms) | Improvement |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Baseline (TP=8, PP=2) | 1.20M          | 0.85      | -           |
| **RA+SP**             | **1.45M**      | **0.70**  | **+20.8% TPS, -17.6% latency** |

### 4.3 Analysis
- **Latency reduction**: Avoids peak bandwidth demands of all-to-all exchanges
- **Memory efficiency**: Reduced activation footprint improves kernel scheduling
- **Consistent benefits**: 20-25% higher TPS and 24-27% higher TPOT across architectures

## 5. Conclusion
RA+SP achieves efficient large-scale inference by combining ring topology for communication efficiency with sequence partitioning for memory reduction. Demonstrated 20.8% TPS improvement and 17.6% latency reduction on 16×H100 GPUs, with benefits scaling for long sequences.

## 6. Future Work
- Extension to training with gradient communication
- Hierarchical topologies (intra-node ring + inter-node bandwidth-aware scheduling)
- Integration with adaptive precision and kernel fusion techniques
