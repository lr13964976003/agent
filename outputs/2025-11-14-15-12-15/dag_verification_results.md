# DAG Verification Results

## Baseline DAG (`baseline_dag_corrected.dot`)
- ✅ **No cycles detected**: The DAG is acyclic
- ✅ **All nodes have inputs**: Only the input node has no incoming edges (as expected)
- ✅ **All nodes have outputs**: Only the output node has no outgoing edges (as expected)

## Proposed DAG (`proposed_dag_corrected.dot`)
- ✅ **No cycles detected**: The DAG is acyclic
- ✅ **All nodes have inputs**: Only the input node has no incoming edges (as expected)
- ✅ **All nodes have outputs**: Only the output node has no outgoing edges (as expected)

## Conclusion
Both DAGs are correctly structured according to the specified requirements. No modifications are needed.
