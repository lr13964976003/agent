# DAG Validation Report

## Summary
All three DAGs have been analyzed according to the specified criteria. **No errors were found**.

## Analysis Results

### 1. LLaMA-7B HPipe DAG
- **Cycle Detection**: ❌ No cycles found
- **Input Node Validation**: ✅ Input node has only outgoing edges (no input nodes)
- **Output Node Validation**: ✅ Output node has only incoming edges (no output nodes)
- **All Other Nodes**: ✅ All intermediate nodes have both input and output connections

### 2. GPT3-2B HPipe DAG  
- **Cycle Detection**: ❌ No cycles found
- **Input Node Validation**: ✅ Input node has only outgoing edges (no input nodes)
- **Output Node Validation**: ✅ Output node has only incoming edges (no output nodes)
- **All Other Nodes**: ✅ All intermediate nodes have both input and output connections

### 3. Baseline Sequential DAG
- **Cycle Detection**: ❌ No cycles found
- **Input Node Validation**: ✅ Input node has only outgoing edges (no input nodes)
- **Output Node Validation**: ✅ Output node has only incoming edges (no output nodes)
- **All Other Nodes**: ✅ All intermediate nodes have both input and output connections

## Technical Details

### Node Analysis Summary
- **Nodes with only inputs** (expected: just output node): Confirmed for all DAGs
- **Nodes with only outputs** (expected: just input node): Confirmed for all DAGs
- **Cycle detection**: All DAGs are acyclic as expected for pipeline parallelism

### DAG Structure Validation
Each DAG follows a proper pipeline structure where:
1. Input receives tokens/sequences from external source
2. Each layer processes data and passes to the next layer
3. Final output produces logits/predictions
4. No backward connections exist (no cycles)
5. All layers except first and last have proper input/output connections

## Conclusion
All DAGs are correctly designed for token-level pipeline parallelism without any structural errors.
