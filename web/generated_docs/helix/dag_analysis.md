# Helix DAG Analysis Results

## DAG Validation Results

### ✅ No Cycles Detected
The DAG contains no cycles - it is a valid Directed Acyclic Graph.

### ✅ Input Node Validation
- **Input node**: "input" - has only outgoing edges to all projection nodes
- All projection nodes (Q, K, V) for all devices receive input from the main input node

### ✅ Output Node Validation
- **Output node**: "output" - has only incoming edges from final_concat
- This is the expected behavior for the final output node

### ✅ Non-Input Node Input Validation
- **Attention nodes**: All attention nodes (device0_attn through device15_attn) have incoming edges from their respective Q, K, V projection nodes
- **Concatenation nodes**: All concat_group nodes have incoming edges from their respective device output nodes
- **Final concat node**: Has incoming edges from all concat_group nodes

### ✅ Non-Output Node Output Validation
- **Projection nodes**: All Q, K, V projection nodes have outgoing edges to their respective attention nodes
- **Attention nodes**: All attention nodes have outgoing edges to their respective output nodes
- **Device output nodes**: All device output nodes have outgoing edges to their respective concat_group nodes
- **Concatenation nodes**: All concat_group nodes have outgoing edges to final_concat
- **Final concat node**: Has outgoing edge to the final output node

## DAG Structure Summary
The DAG represents a two-level attention partitioning scheme with:
- 16 GPUs total in a 4×4 partitioning
- Input broadcast to all 48 projection nodes (16 devices × 3 projections each)
- 16 attention computation paths
- 4 concatenation groups
- Final concatenation to produce output

## Conclusion
The DAG is correctly structured according to all validation criteria:
1. ✅ No cycles present
2. ✅ All non-input nodes have at least one input node
3. ✅ All non-output nodes have at least one output node

Status: **VALID** - No modifications required.
