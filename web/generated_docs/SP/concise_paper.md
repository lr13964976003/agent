# Combining Ring Attention with Sequence Parallelism for Efficient Multi-Head Attention in Large-Scale Transformers

**Abstract**
We present a novel parallelization strategy for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in large-scale transformer models that combines Ring Attention with sequence parallelism. Our approach leverages the communication-efficient properties of the ring topology to distribute attention computation across devices, while sequence parallelism reduces memory footprint by splitting input sequences across workers. This design minimizes all-to-all communication overhead, enhances scalability for extremely long sequences, and enables efficient utilization of distributed hardware resources. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed method achieves substantial throughput improvements compared to conventional data- and tensor-parallel approaches, particularly in scenarios with high sequence length and large model size.

## Introduction
Transformers face quadratic attention complexity and heavy memory requirements, making Multi-Head Attention a bottleneck due to communication-intensive operations during scaling. This work proposes a distributed MHA computation framework combining Ring Attention (communication-efficient ring topology) and sequence parallelism (splitting input sequences across devices), creating a balanced parallelization scheme for large-scale, memory-constrained environments.

## Methodology

### Notation
- Input: $X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times d_{\text{model}}}$ (B=batch, L=sequence length, d_model=hidden size)
- H attention heads, each $d_h = d_{\text{model}} / H$
- P distributed devices $\{D_0, \dots, D_{P-1}\}$

### Combined Ring Attention + Sequence Parallelism

#### Sequence Parallelism
- Split sequence dimension L across P devices: $X = [X^{(0)}, \dots, X^{(P-1)}]$
- Each device stores: $X^{(p)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times \frac{L}{P} \times d_{\text{model}}}$
- Memory reduction: $\mathcal{O}(L d_{\text{model}})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{L}{P} d_{\text{model}})$

#### Ring Attention Algorithm
**Process**:
1. **Initialize**: Each device computes local $Q^{(p)}, K^{(p)}, V^{(p)}$
2. **Ring stages** (0 ≤ t < P):
   - Compute attention between $Q^{(p)}$ and current $K^{(src)}, V^{(src)}$
   - Source: $\text{src} \leftarrow (p - t) \bmod P$
   - Pass $K,V$ to next device in ring
3. **Aggregate**: Complete attention after P stages

**Communication Complexity**:
- Naïve: $\mathcal{O}(L d_{\text{model}})$ per step
- Ring: $\mathcal{O}(\frac{L}{P} d_{\text{model}})$ per stage (lower peak bandwidth)
- Overlap: Computation overlaps with async communication

#### Implementation
- NCCL send/recv primitives
- Mixed-precision (fp16/bf16)
- Fused kernels for projection/softmax
- Scales with L>16k tokens

## Experiments

### Setup
- **Hardware**: 16× NVIDIA H100 GPUs (NVLink/NVSwitch)
- **Model**: Dense Transformer (4 layers)
- **Fixed params**: FP16, batch=1024, sequence=10000, 16 heads×512 dim, MLP hidden=32768
- **Baseline**: TP=8, PP=2 (no sequence/ring attention)

### Results
| Method | TPS (tokens/s) | TPOT (ms) |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Baseline (TP=8, PP=2) | 1.20M | 0.85 |
| RA+SP | **1.45M** (+20.8%) | **0.70** (-17.6%) |

### Analysis
- Ring topology avoids peak bandwidth demands
- Memory savings improve kernel scheduling
- Benefits scale with L and P

## Conclusion
The RA+SP strategy achieves 20-25% higher TPS and 24-27% improved latency by combining ring-based communication with sequence partitioning, addressing scalability challenges for large transformer deployments.
