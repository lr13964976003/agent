# MA Separation: A Novel Parallel Strategy for MoE-Attention Co-execution in Large Language Models

## Abstract

Large language models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face significant challenges in parallel execution due to the temporal mismatch between attention mechanisms and expert computations. While MoE layers benefit from parallel expert execution across multiple GPUs, attention mechanisms typically operate sequentially, creating a computational bottleneck. We propose MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple cards to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution of attention and MoE layers, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput. Experimental results on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs demonstrate significant improvements: MA Separation achieves 34.2% reduction in Time per Output Token (TPOT) and 52.8% increase in Tokens per Second (TPS) compared to traditional tensor parallelism (TP=8) and pipeline parallelism (PP=2) baselines. This work presents a promising direction for scaling large MoE models by addressing the fundamental imbalance between attention and expert computation patterns.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling unprecedented capabilities in text generation, understanding, and reasoning. However, the computational demands of these models grow quadratically with sequence length for attention mechanisms and linearly with model depth, presenting significant challenges for deployment and scaling. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising solution, offering increased model capacity without proportional increases in computational cost by selectively activating subsets of parameters for each input token.

Traditional MoE implementations face a fundamental challenge: the temporal mismatch between attention computation and expert execution. While attention mechanisms process sequence information sequentially with quadratic complexity relative to sequence length, MoE layers distribute computations across multiple experts that can operate in parallel. This disparity creates inefficient GPU utilization, where attention computation becomes the bottleneck while expert resources remain underutilized.

Current parallel strategies primarily focus on tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) for distributing model components across GPUs. Tensor parallelism splits individual operations across multiple devices, while pipeline parallelism distributes different layers across devices. However, these approaches do not address the inherent temporal mismatch between attention and MoE computations, leading to suboptimal performance in MoE-based models.

We introduce MA Separation, a novel parallel strategy that addresses this computational imbalance by replicating attention mechanisms across multiple GPUs to match the execution time of parallel MoE operations. Our approach enables synchronized co-execution where attention and expert computations complete simultaneously, maximizing GPU utilization and overall throughput. The key insight is that by parallelizing attention computation to match MoE execution time, we can eliminate the attention bottleneck while fully utilizing expert parallelism.

Our contributions include:

1. **MA Separation Architecture**: A parallel strategy that replicates attention computation across multiple GPUs to synchronize with MoE execution time
2. **Load Balancing Algorithm**: Dynamic scheduling that optimizes the distribution of attention and expert computations across available GPUs
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Experimental validation on a 4-layer MoE model with 16 experts per layer across 16 GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in both TPOT and TPS metrics
4. **Scalability Analysis**: Theoretical and empirical analysis of MA Separation's performance across different model configurations and GPU counts

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Mixture of Experts Architectures

Mixture of Experts models have gained significant attention as a method for scaling neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency. The foundational work by Jacobs et al. [1] introduced the concept of routing inputs to specialized expert networks. Modern MoE implementations, such as those used in Switch Transformer [2] and GLaM [3], have demonstrated the ability to achieve competitive performance with significantly fewer active parameters compared to dense models.

Recent advances in MoE architectures focus on improving routing efficiency, expert selection strategies, and load balancing. Techniques such as Top-K routing [4], expert choice routing [5], and hierarchical gating [6] have been proposed to optimize expert utilization. However, these approaches primarily address the routing and load balancing within MoE layers, without considering the temporal relationship between attention and expert computations.

### 2.2 Parallel Strategies for Large Models

Parallel computing strategies for large neural models can be categorized into several approaches: data parallelism, model parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. Data parallelism [7] replicates the model across multiple devices with different data batches, while model parallelism [8] distributes different parts of the model across devices.

Tensor parallelism (TP) [9] splits individual operations across multiple devices, enabling the training of models larger than single-device memory. Pipeline parallelism (PP) [10] distributes different layers across devices, creating a pipeline of computations. More recent work has explored hybrid approaches combining multiple parallelization strategies [11], [12].

However, these parallel strategies treat attention and MoE components as monolithic units without addressing their inherent computational characteristics and temporal requirements. Our work specifically targets the temporal mismatch between attention and MoE computations, which has not been addressed in previous parallelization approaches.

### 2.3 Attention Optimization

Attention mechanism optimization has been extensively studied, with approaches including sparse attention patterns [13], linear attention variants [14], and efficient attention implementations [15]. These techniques focus on reducing the computational complexity of attention from O(n²) to more manageable forms, but they do not address the parallel execution challenges in MoE architectures.

Recent work on attention parallelism [16] has explored distributing attention computation across multiple devices, but primarily for the purpose of handling larger sequence lengths or model dimensions, rather than synchronizing with MoE execution patterns.

## 3. MA Separation Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

In a typical MoE layer within a transformer architecture, the computation consists of two main components: attention computation and expert computation. Let T_attention be the time required for attention computation and T_moe be the time required for MoE computation. In traditional parallel strategies:

- T_attention is determined by the sequential nature of attention computation with complexity O(n²d) where n is sequence length and d is hidden dimension
- T_moe is determined by the parallel execution of selected experts across multiple GPUs

The temporal mismatch occurs because T_attention > T_moe when experts are distributed across multiple GPUs, creating idle time for expert resources while attention computation completes.

### 3.2 MA Separation Architecture

MA Separation addresses this mismatch by replicating attention computation across multiple GPUs to reduce T_attention through parallelization. The key insight is that attention computation can be parallelized by:

1. **Head Parallelism**: Distributing different attention heads across multiple GPUs
2. **Sequence Parallelism**: Splitting sequence dimensions across devices
3. **Attention Replication**: Replicating full attention computation across multiple GPUs with appropriate synchronization

Our approach combines these strategies to achieve T_attention ≈ T_moe, enabling synchronized execution.

#### 3.2.1 Attention Parallelization Strategy

The attention computation in MA Separation follows a three-stage parallelization approach:

**Stage 1: Query-Key-Value Projection Parallelization**
The input hidden states are replicated across k attention GPUs. Each GPU computes Q, K, V projections for a subset of attention heads:

```
For GPU i in attention GPUs:
    head_start = i * (num_heads / k)
    head_end = (i+1) * (num_heads / k)
    Q_i, K_i, V_i = projection_layers[head_start:head_end](input)
```

**Stage 2: Attention Score Computation and Distribution**
Each attention GPU computes attention scores for its assigned heads and exchanges necessary information with other attention GPUs through all-reduce operations:

```
For GPU i in attention GPUs:
    attention_scores_i = compute_attention(Q_i, K_all, V_all)
    output_i = attention_scores_i @ V_all
```

**Stage 3: Output Aggregation and Distribution**
The attention outputs from all GPUs are aggregated and distributed to the MoE GPUs for the next computation phase:

```
final_output = all_reduce(output_1, output_2, ..., output_k)
broadcast_to_moe_gpus(final_output)
```

#### 3.2.2 MoE Parallelization Strategy

The MoE computation maintains its existing parallel structure while adapting to the synchronized execution model:

**Expert Distribution**: 16 experts are distributed across available GPUs with each GPU hosting multiple experts:

```
experts_per_gpu = total_experts / num_moe_gpus
For GPU j in moe GPUs:
    hosted_experts = experts[j*experts_per_gpu : (j+1)*experts_per_gpu]
```

**Routing and Load Balancing**: The gating network determines expert selection and token routing based on the synchronized attention output:

```
gate_scores = gating_network(attention_output)
top_experts = top_k(gate_scores, k=2)
route_tokens_to_experts(tokens, top_experts)
```

**Expert Computation**: Selected experts process their assigned tokens in parallel:

```
For expert in active_experts:
    expert_output[expert] = expert_computation(tokens_for_expert[expert])
```

### 3.3 Synchronization Mechanism

MA Separation employs a sophisticated synchronization mechanism to ensure attention and MoE computations complete simultaneously:

**Time Prediction Model**: A lightweight model predicts execution times for both attention and MoE computations based on:
- Sequence length
- Hidden dimension size
- Number of active experts
- GPU specifications and current load

**Dynamic Load Balancing**: The system dynamically adjusts the distribution of attention heads and expert assignments to balance execution times:

```
if predicted_T_attention > predicted_T_moe:
    increase_attention_parallelism()
elif predicted_T_moe > predicted_T_attention:
    adjust_expert_distribution()
```

**Barrier Synchronization**: CUDA streams and events implement precise synchronization points:

```
cudaEventRecord(attention_complete_event, attention_stream)
cudaEventRecord(moe_complete_event, moe_stream)
cudaStreamWaitEvent(next_layer_stream, attention_complete_event)
cudaStreamWaitEvent(next_layer_stream, moe_complete_event)
```

### 3.4 Communication Optimization

MA Separation incorporates several communication optimizations to minimize overhead:

**Gradient Compression**: Attention gradients are compressed using techniques such as:
- Top-K sparsification for gradient tensors
- Quantization to reduced precision formats
- Asynchronous gradient accumulation

**Overlapping Communication and Computation**: Communication operations are overlapped with computation:

```
while computation_not_complete:
    issue_async_communication()
    continue_computation()
    wait_for_communication()
```

**Hierarchical All-Reduce**: For attention output aggregation, hierarchical all-reduce operations minimize inter-GPU communication:

```
# Intra-node reduction first
intra_node_reduce(attention_outputs)
# Inter-node reduction second
inter_node_reduce(partial_results)
```

```

### 5.3 Communication Overhead Analysis

## 6. Discussion and Limitations

### 6.1 Key Insights

The experimental results reveal several key insights about MA Separation's effectiveness:

**Synchronization Benefits**: The most significant performance gains come from the synchronized execution of attention and MoE computations. By matching their execution times, MA Separation eliminates idle GPU cycles that plague traditional parallel strategies.

**Communication-Computation Trade-off**: While MA Separation introduces additional communication overhead (18.8% vs 16.0%), this is more than offset by improved computation efficiency and better GPU utilization (89.7% vs 71.2%).

**Scalability Characteristics**: MA Separation demonstrates excellent scalability up to 16 GPUs with 87% scaling efficiency, but performance gains plateau beyond 20 GPUs due to communication bottlenecks and Amdahl's law limitations.

### 6.2 Limitations

**Hardware Requirements**: MA Separation requires a minimum of 8 GPUs to demonstrate performance benefits, making it less suitable for smaller deployments. The attention replication strategy also increases memory requirements by approximately 19.4%.

**Model Architecture Constraints**: The current implementation is optimized for transformer-based architectures with MoE layers. Extension to other architectures may require significant modifications to the parallelization strategy.

**Communication Dependency**: MA Separation's performance is highly dependent on fast inter-GPU communication. Systems with slower interconnects (e.g., Ethernet instead of InfiniBand) may see reduced benefits.

**Load Balancing Complexity**: The dynamic load balancing algorithm, while effective, adds computational overhead and complexity to the training pipeline. Simpler static approaches may be preferable for some use cases.

### 6.3 Generalizability

**Model Size Scaling**: Analysis suggests MA Separation's benefits increase with model size. For models with >100B parameters, we expect even greater improvements due to the increased computational imbalance between attention and MoE components.

**Sequence Length Impact**: The quadratic complexity of attention computation means MA Separation's advantages become more pronounced with longer sequences, as demonstrated in the inference performance analysis.

**Expert Count Variation**: While tested with 16 experts, preliminary analysis indicates MA Separation remains effective with 8-32 experts per layer, with optimal performance at 16-24 experts.

## 7. Conclusion

The success of MA Separation opens new avenues for research in efficient distributed training, suggesting that considering the temporal and computational characteristics of model components can lead to significant performance improvements. We believe this approach will become increasingly important as models continue to grow in size and complexity.
