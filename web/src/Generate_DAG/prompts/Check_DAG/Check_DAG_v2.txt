RESOURCES

---

You have been provided with some directed acyclic graph(DAG) provided by the previous agent. <<<提供dag>>>

TASK

---

You are tested to completed the following tasks:

Check if there are any errors in the DAG. The specific inspection items are as follows:<<<任务内容>>>

Check if the DAG contains a cycle. <<<检查dag中是否包含环>>>

Check whether all nodes in the DAG, except for the input, have at least one input node.<<<检查是否除了input外，有节点没有输入>>>

Check whether all nodes in the DAG, except for the output, have at least one output node.<<<检查是否除了output外，有节点没有输出>>>



NOTE

---

You need to follow the following constraints:

Do not make any changes to the original file.<<<禁止修改源文件>>>

You can use tools to directly retrieve the content of graph connections in the DAG.<<<提醒可以用工具直接获取图的连接方式>>>

This will be a task with many steps. Please ensure you have fully understood the dag.



SUBMISSION

---

Is this DAG incorrect. If incorrect, where to modify.  Save the nodes that need to be modified in markdown format at the {save_path}.

If there are no issues, please say "Congratulation!!" at first and provide the path for submitting the DAG in JSON format.

How we would grade this:

Understand: We will check whether you have read and understood the DAG.

Result: We will check whether your conclusion meets the expected standards.
