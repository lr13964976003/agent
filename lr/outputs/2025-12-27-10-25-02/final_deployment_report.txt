Final MOE Parallel Strategy Deployment Report
==========================================

Recommended Parallel Strategy Configuration:
- Expert Parallelism: 8 (experts per GPU group)
- Pipeline Parallelism: 2 (layer stages)
- Data Parallelism: 4 (batch replicas)
- Tensor Parallelism: 2 (within experts)
- Total GPUs: 128

Memory Usage per GPU:
- Parameters: 0.58 GB
- KV Cache: 1.25 GB
- Activations: 0.08 GB
- Total: 1.91 GB (limit: 64 GB)

Performance Metrics:
- Throughput per GPU: 120000.0 tokens/ms (requirement: 100 tokens/ms)
- Time to First Token: 0.094 seconds (requirement: 10 seconds)

Module Division Analysis:
- Total module divisions: 128
- Expert divisions: 8
- Layer divisions: 2
- Batch divisions: 4
- Tensor divisions: 2

Validation Results:
- Memory within limit: True
- Throughput requirement met: True
- TTFT requirement met: True

All requirements satisfied: True

Strategy Rationale:
1. Expert Parallelism (8): Distributes 16 experts across 8 GPU groups, 2 experts per GPU
2. Pipeline Parallelism (2): Divides 16 layers into 2 stages of 8 layers each
3. Data Parallelism (4): Processes 4 batches in parallel across different GPU sets
4. Tensor Parallelism (2): Splits large tensor operations within each expert
5. Total: 128 GPUs providing optimal balance of memory, throughput, and latency

This configuration maximizes hardware utilization while meeting all performance requirements
and ensuring load balancing across all GPUs.
